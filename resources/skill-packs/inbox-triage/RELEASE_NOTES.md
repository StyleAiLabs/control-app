# Inbox Triage — Release Notes

## 1.1.1

- label changed

## 1.1.0

- Added `occurred_at` to manifest `required_success_fields` so the analytics helper enforces timestamp validation on every conversion payload.
- Changed hardcoded `"currency": "USD"` to `"<tenant-currency>"` placeholder in the recommended payload shape to support non-US tenants.
- Added `agent-instructions.md` so the OpenClaw agent uses this custom skill instead of its default email handling behavior.
